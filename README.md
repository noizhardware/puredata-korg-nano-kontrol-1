# puredata-korg-nano-kontrol-1

abstraction for Korg Nano Kontrol 1


this abstraction sends data from the Korg Nano Kontrol version1 in the format s(scenenumber)[letter][number]
[letter] is: b=button f=fader p=potentiometer

e.g. s1b3 is button 3 of scene 1
s2f4 is fader 4, scene 2
s3p5 is potentiometer 5, scene 3

scene 4 has hardware built-in latching buttons, nanok sends 0/1 toggle values, according to the hardware on/off LEDs

bg = Button Gate, sends a "1" until the key remains pressed, a 0 when itÂ´is unpressed

e.g. s1bg3 is the gate for button 3, scene 1
